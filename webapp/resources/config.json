This dataset includes an estimation of the annual physical exposure to drought based on Standardized Precipitation Index. The dataset is based on four sources: 1) A global monthly gridded precipitation dataset obtained from the Climatic Research Unit (University of East Anglia); 2) A GIS modelling of global Standardized Precipitation Index based on Brad Lyon (IRI, Columbia University) methodology; 3) A population grid for the year 2010, provided by LandScanTM Global Population Database (Oak Ridge, TN: Oak Ridge National Laboratory). Unit is expected average annual population (2010 as the year of reference) exposed (inhabitants). This product was designed by UNEP/GRID-Europe for the Global Assessment Report on Risk Reduction (GAR). It was modelled using global data. Data was resampled to 1 km resolution using Resampling tool in ArcGIS; and 4) Community mapping of dry spell areas across the Mangochi district conducted by C12 Consultants in 2016 collating expert information on 1:50,000 scale topographic maps issued by the Malawi Surveys Department, then digitized on QGIS platform.”",

The return period is a probabilistic estimate of the size of a flood event that is likely to occur in a specified amount of time. Therefore, a 100-year flood will be larger than a 10-year flood as a flood of that size is expected to occur less frequently, or approximately every 100 years.",

The data is a snippet of the ASTER global DEM, developed by The Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI) of Japan and the United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). You can click anywhere on the elevation model in order to identify the elevation value at that point. DEM usage note: the elevation values should not be taken as completely accurate at the local level as the accuracy is between 6 metres and 16 metres, i.e. individual elevation values in the DEM can be between 6 and 16 metres different from real life. The model gives a broad view of the topography and estimates of elevation at regional scales, but the elevation of a specific point should always be cross-referenced with a GPS waypoint at that location.",
