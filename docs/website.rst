all layers in the Web Mercator projection (EPSG:3857).

* The map can be navigated by panning with the mouse. Zooming is possible with the mouse wheel, a double-click or with the zoom buttons on the top left.
* The button on the top right activates an overview map.
* Clicking `Shift` makes it possible to draw a rectangle where the map shall be zoomed to.
* The basemap can be switched from topographic to satellite using the basemap button on the top left.

Layer Tree

The layer tree on the left side holds all available layers. Each layer is grouped in a parent group and a sub group.

* Hovering over the items shows an description.
* Ticking a layer or a layer group toggles the visibility of the layer.
* Each layer has an information button. Clicking this one opens up a information panel on the bottom left.
* The download button downloads the layer in the GeoPackage format which can be displayed in a desktop GIS like QGIS. Downloading only works for vector data, downloading raster data is not supported.
* The "eye" symbol can change the transparency of the layer
* The layers can be re-ordered by clicking on them and draging them to the required position.
